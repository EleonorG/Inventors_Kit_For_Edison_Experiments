Inventor's Kit for Edison Experiments
=====================================

The [SparkFun Inventor's Kit for Intel® Edison](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13742), otherwise known as the <i>Edison SIK</i>, introduces the Edison as a powerful Internet of Things (IoT) platform. The experiments contained within these pages will guide you through programming the Edison using [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) and controlling various electronics. Whether you are new to electronics and JavaScript or are looking to take your skills to the next level (to the "cloud!"), this kit is a great starting point.
